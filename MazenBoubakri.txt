Section 1: General Awareness

	*Web Development Basics:
		well web dev is that important for the internet because 
		without it the internet will be empty or unmaintained.

	*HTML Knowledge:
		well im a junior graphic designer and i interacted with the HTML several times,
		and for me the HTML is always like the chassis of the project like the chassis of a building 
		without it u have no idea where to put the doors nor where the walls will be. 

Section 2: Familiarity with CSS

	*CSS Understanding:
		as a designer i need to be familiar with CSS and as i said about the HTML i think the CSS is like the
		step where u work on the thinks that everybody will see in ur website like the graphic part and a bit 
		advanced where u paint ur building style ur rooms etc.

Section 3: JavaScript and Its Importance
	
	*Introduction to JavaScript:
		i actually have a bit of knowledge on JS but i think i know its purpose exactly where it plays the dynamic
		part of the project and it brings live to it which will make it both more catching the eye and exiting like 
		in a building when u add windows, doors, furniture that make the building dynamic.

Section 4: Introduction to React and Node.js

	*React and Node.js Awareness:
		about react and node.js i almost have no clue beside that react is more of a frontend tool and the node.js
		is more of a backend tool but im pretty sure i will have a good idea about them very soon and i cant really 		wait.
	
Section 5: Bonus Question

	*Learning Intentions:
		well im a designer and i think i entered the industry from the wrong side, im working with d√©velopper that 		can almost do my job with the dev knwoledge already acquired. soo i though why not doing both too and 			Expanding expertise soo that will help in choosing a better career and will make me open for bigger and 		better roles.
