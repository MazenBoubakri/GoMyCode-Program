
	* How does the web work? 

	The web works by sending and receiving information through the internet using websites that are accessed 	with browsers. 

	* What do you need to be a web developer?

	first of all and for me specially u need to enjoy what ur doing and commit to it to keep moving forward 	because its not an easy path, then professionally  to be a web developer u need to acquire several coding 	languages and mastering many tools to be able to easily build ur website from scratch.

	* Why did you choose to learn web development?

	for me i choose to learn web development as an upgrade to my current career 'graphic designer' and to sharpen 	my already acquired skills in the web development and generally to put my commitment in a real test.
